This project is to predict solar power generated in kilowatt using enviromental features like azimuth, 
angle of incidence, wind direction etc.It will help local consummers of solar energy to know the amount of solar energy that would be generated 
in the future and let them know if the installed solar energy equipments and materials like the solar pannels, charge controllers, and
inverters are working at optimum level which would help them to know the components efficiency level to avoid system collapse. 
This project can also be used to checkmate the level of effect of climate change to the solar system.
